# Polymer-Segmentation-Model
SImple degradation model of polymer chain length in a ball mill grinder. 
Model obtained from Glynn et al. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/10601327208056918.
Example file of experimental result of polystyrene milled at 20 Hz (300 mg with two stainless steel balls with radius of of 7 mm in a 10 mL stainless steel chamber) in a ball mill grinder over the course of 8 hours.
Comparing experimental and modelled results indicate that the polymer break within the inner 9% of its length, which is in agreement with literature results for shear flow and ultrasonication modelling of polymer segmentation (10.1016/j.polymer.2003.11.051 \& https://doi.org/10.1080/10601327208056918).
